    "In this activity, you’ll make three API calls to Quandl to find the cost of a Big Mac in three countries.\n",
    " \n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the `Unsolved` folder for this activity, create an environment file (`.env`). Enter your QUANDL_API_KEY into this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the Jupyter notebook, load the environment variables into your environment file by using the `load_dotenv()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Get the Quandl API key from the environment variables, and store it in a Python variable named `quandl_api_key`. Then confirm that you successfully imported the API key by checking its type with the `type` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create two variables named `start_date` and `end_date` to define the period that you want to get the Big Mac index for. For this activity, you can set both dates to `2020-07-31`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Review the endpoint URLs that the starter notebook supplies. You’ll use these URLs to access the endpoints for the Big Mac index from three countries: the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Hint** The Big Mac Index database from Quandl includes data from different countries. Each country's dataset has a Quandl code with the following format:  ECONOMIST/BIGMAC_{COUNTRY}. This activity uses USA, CAN, and MEX for the country codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Make the authenticated API request for each country by using the `request.get` function. Then print the response data by using the `json.dump` function. Analyze the data. Note that all the countries have the same output structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Review the output from the Big Mac Index for the United States. Identify the key-value pairs that define the response object. Determine how to get the `dollar_price` and `dollar_ppp` data elements. Use this information to create a DataFrame with the data of these indicators for the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The following image shows how your DataFrame should appear:\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Use the DataFrame to create a bar chart that compares the `dollar_price` and the `dollar_ppp` of the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\n",
